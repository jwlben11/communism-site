## What is gish gallop

A gish gallop is a way of arguing where someone throws many weak or false/half-truth arguments at once, making it hard to respond to all of them in the limited time.

Each point raised by the Gish galloper takes considerably longer to refute than to assert. 

The technique wastes time and can make the opponent look bad to an audience that doesn't know better, especially without fact-checking or if the audience lacks topic knowledge.

## Countering the Gish gallop

1. Because there are too many falsehoods to address, it is wise to choose one as an example. Choose the weakest, dumbest, most ludicrous argument that the galloper has presented and tear that argument to shreds ("the weak point rebuttal").
2. Do not budge from the issue or move on until having decisively destroyed the nonsense and clearly made the counter point.
3. Call out the strategy by name, saying: "This is a strategy called the 'Gish Gallop'â€”do not be fooled by the flood of nonsense you have just heard."

You can also counter all the common arguments that may be raised by your opponent beforehand to block some of the galloping.

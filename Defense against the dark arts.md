- [[Marrying a truth to a lie]]
- Creating false dichotomies
- [[Gish gallop]]
- [[Argumentum Verbosum]]

Here's a step by step method to use all the above techniques:
1. If they're making a lot of points non-stops, ask them to slow down so we can address each claims
2. If they use obscure words, ask them to use simpler terms
3. Break down their arguments into smaller proposition and conclusions
4. Make sure there's equivalence between proposition and conclusion. (See [[Marrying a truth to a lie]])
5. What are their assumptions?
6. Check if what they said also applies in a socialist state

You must also remember that the communist share your vocabulary, but they don't share your dictionary.

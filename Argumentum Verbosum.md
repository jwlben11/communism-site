It is a specific form of hand waving where someone advances an argument by giving a loaded argument with a lot of obscure words or by marking it as obvious or trivial.

It attempts to intimidate the audience into simply accepting the result without evidence by appealing to their ignorance or lack of understanding

You can see it coming with:
- "Clearly..."
- "It is self-evident that..."
- "It can be easily shown that..."
- "... does not warrant a proof."
- "The proof is left as an exercise for the reader."
- "It is trivial..."
## How to defend against this

1. Ask for a simple explanation.
2. Summarize what you think they said, to clarify.
3. Focus on key points and ignore extra details.
4. Keep questions direct and to the point.
